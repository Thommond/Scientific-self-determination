    <p>
      Ultimatly our ideas are found by you. You define this party. You choose
      these leaders, it is no deception.

      <h3>Government for the people, no really.</h3>

      <p>
        We are once again trying to make it so the government has to make the
        majority agree with all of its actions and powers.

      <h3>Party for the people.</h3>

      <p>
        We are first of all pluralistic, based on what works and what can pay
        for itself provided all powers agree. We are pro-life, and pro-choice in
        the furthest way possible. We agree to not enforce our own biased dogma
        on other houses, businesses and communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not destriminate based on values, we want success for people with
        sense of community, hardwork and have the ablility to get along.

      <h3>What we are against</h3>

      <p>
        We are against the current path of monopolies, duoloplies, and forms of
        slavery. All unsustanable systems inclduing genocide have this in
        common, no check on power and the concent of the people. Voting consent
        is needed to stop the repetition of central force.
